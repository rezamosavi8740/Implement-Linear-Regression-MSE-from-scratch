## Linear Regression Model

This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple Linear Regression model. Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for predicting numeric values based on a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.

### Usage

The `LinearRegression` class in this code allows you to create and train a Linear Regression model with customizable learning rate and iterations. Here's how to use the code:

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
import numpy as np

# Create a Linear Regression object
model = LinearRegression(learning_rate=0.01, iterations=1000)

# Prepare your training data - X and Y are NumPy arrays with input features and target values
X = ...
Y = ...

# Train the model on the data
model.fit(X, Y)

# Make predictions on new data
new_data = ...
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```

### Constructor

The `LinearRegression` class constructor takes two parameters:

- `learning_rate`: The learning rate used in gradient descent for updating the model's weights during training.
- `iterations`: The number of iterations the model will run gradient descent during the training process.

### Methods

1. `fit(X, Y)`: This method is used to train the Linear Regression model with the given training data `X` and target values `Y`.

2. `predict(X)`: This method takes input data `X` and returns the predictions based on the trained model.

### How it works

The implementation uses a gradient descent algorithm to optimize the model's parameters (`W` and `b`) for the best fit to the training data. The training process iteratively updates the model's weights using the gradients of the mean squared error loss with respect to `W` and `b`.

Remember to install the necessary libraries before using the code. You can do this by running:

```
pip install numpy
```

Feel free to customize the learning rate and the number of iterations according to your specific dataset and requirements. Happy coding!
